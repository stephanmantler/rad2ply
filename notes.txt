Example to read the data:

import pickle
import numpy as np

with open('20220901_flight2.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)

for k in data:
    print(f"[{k}] shape: {np.shape(data[k])}")
    
Expected output (annotated with extra notes):

[return_power] shape: (2241, 2666) # (2241 by 2666) where 2241 is the number of range bins and 2666 is the number of timesteps
[slow_time] shape: (2666,) # relative timestamps in seconds
[distance_to_reflector] shape: (2241,) # one-way distance to a reflector assuming propagation velocity in ice (speed of light / sqrt(3.17))
[lat] shape: (2666,) # latitude
[lon] shape: (2666,) # longitude
[alt_rel] shape: (2666,) # relative altitude (relative to launch position)
[dist] shape: (2666,) # very noisy data from the laser rangefinder
